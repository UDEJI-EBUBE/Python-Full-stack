# Day 73 – Data Analysis

Today, I wrapped up the final tasks in this data analysis section.  
I explored posts per programming language using `.groupby()`, converted strings to Datetime with `to_datetime()` for easier plotting, reshaped the DataFrame by pivoting categories into columns, checked for NaNs with `.count()` and `.isna().values.any()` and filled missing values with `.fillna()`.  

I also created multiple line charts in a loop, styled them with size adjustments, axis limits, and labels, added legends for clarity, and smoothed time-series data with `.rolling().mean()` to better identify trends.  

**Note:** This will be my final entry in the data analysis part, as I have lost interest and will focus on areas I am more passionate about.
