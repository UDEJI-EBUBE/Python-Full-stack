# Python
Today we embarked on another project called the ceasar cipher which was fun 😁.<br>
I think the only new concept of today was using the method count() to find the number of occurrences of something

Learnt about parameters and arguments today.
Although not that much important i learnt that when passing arguments in a function you can pass it as a value to the variable that way no matter the position it is placed it will still be assigned properly

```
def introduce(name, age, country):
    print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and I live in {country}.")

# Normal positional arguments (must follow the function order)
introduce("Ebube", 17, "Nigeria")

# Keyword arguments (order doesn't matter)
introduce(age=17, country="Nigeria", name="Ebube")

A simple way to go down multiple lines is by using
Print("\n" * 100)
```
