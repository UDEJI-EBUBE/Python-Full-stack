# Python
We talked about passing arguments into a function.<br>
We also discussed about the return statement which can be used to stop the execution of the rest of a function <br>
I leart that just like how when you are using a built in function function in python you will see the description of that function. This can also be applied in the function you create by using what we call docstrings 
example
```
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Adds two numbers and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int or float): The first number.
    b (int or float): The second number.

    Returns:
    int or float: The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    return a + b
```
