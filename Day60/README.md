### 🚀 Day 60 of My Python & Flask Journey

Today’s focus was on **handling forms in Flask** — a very important part of building interactive web applications.

I learnt how to:

🔹 Use the **action** and **method** attributes in HTML forms to control how data is sent  
🔹 Make **POST requests** from the browser to the server  
🔹 Use the **name** attribute to correctly capture input values with `request.form` in Flask  
🔹 Process form data on the backend and trigger server-side actions  
🔹 Return feedback to the user after submitting a form  

After understanding these concepts, I applied everything to improve the blog project from **Day 59**.

💡 The major upgrade today was implementing a fully functional **Contact Page**.  
Submitting the form now sends a real message through email using `SMTP_SSL`.  
This means the blog is no longer static — users can now reach out directly from the site.

Today’s work tied together HTML form handling, Flask routing, POST requests, and backend email functionality.

Steady progress. On to Day 61! 🚀
