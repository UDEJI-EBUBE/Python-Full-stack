## Day 58 — Exploring Bootstrap Layouts & Components

Today’s session in the course focused fully on Bootstrap — no Python or Flask coding was covered. The goal was to understand Bootstrap on its own so that integrating it with Flask later will be smoother and more effective.

The lesson covered:

- The Bootstrap Grid System — how rows and columns create responsive layouts.  
- Containers — container and container-fluid, and how they influence spacing and width.  
- Breakpoints — making layouts adapt beautifully across mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Core Components — buttons, cards, navbars, forms, and how Bootstrap provides clean, reusable UI elements.

Dedicating the day to Bootstrap helped build a stronger foundation for when the course starts combining frontend structure with Flask backend work.

Looking forward to the next steps. �
