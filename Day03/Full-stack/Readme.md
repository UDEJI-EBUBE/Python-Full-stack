Today was all about lists and img

She talked a bout the usual ordered and unordered but the one that peaked my interest was when list were nested to make a list in list. Guess I never thought about that, it is done like this

<ul>

<li></li>

<li>

<ol>

<li></li>

<li></li>

<ol>

</li>

</ul>

For images, it was the same. Knew most of the things taught but only one thing stood out which was the use of /<size> in the link of the image to make it a square with those proportions

Anchor tags were also mentioned with the only useful point there being using "draggable=true" to make a tag draggable

That is all for today
