# Namespaces: Global and local scope
Today we treated local and global scope. A global scope is one that is not declared inside a function while a local scope is one where the variable is declared inside a function.
>[!NOTE]
>if a variable is defined inside a loop it is still a global scope but sometimes you will get a correction because the function is defined inside a loop or if/else statements so there is a probablity that the variable will not run becaus the loop or the statement will not run because it is bound by a condition, so to fix this it is advised to declare the variable outside the loop and assign a random value to it so it doesn't affect the loop or statements
