Python
Learnt about parameters and arguments today.
Although not that much important i learnt that when passing arguments in a function you can pass it as a value to the variable that way no matter the position it is placed it will still be assigned properly

def introduce(name, age, country):
    print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old, and I live in {country}.")

# Normal positional arguments (must follow the function order)
introduce("Ebube", 17, "Nigeria")

# Keyword arguments (order doesn't matter)
introduce(age=17, country="Nigeria", name="Ebube")

A simple way to go down multiple lines is by using
Print("\n" * 100)
