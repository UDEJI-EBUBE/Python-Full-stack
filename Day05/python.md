Python

The highlight of today was loops and how it can be applied. Talked about the range function and how it can be used to make the loop perform a certain amount of time. Learnt two new random methods today which were

random.choice(): Used to select a value from a list

random.shuffle(): rearranges a list

Also talked about list which to me is a very familiar topic.
