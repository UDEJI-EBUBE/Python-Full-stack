**Day 65 – Color Theory & Typography Breakthrough 🎨✍️**

Today's session took a pause on Python so we could focus on two essential foundations of great web design: **Color Theory** and **Typography**.

These are not just “design topics” — they directly influence how users feel, read, and interact with a website. Getting them right means building interfaces that are not only functional, but visually balanced and easy to use.

🔹 **Color Theory**  
We explored how colors can guide attention, create hierarchy, and set the emotional tone of a website. Understanding contrast, harmony, saturation, and accessibility helps in choosing colors that work well together and remain readable across devices.

🔹 **Typography**  
We also looked at how font choices, size hierarchy, spacing, and alignment all combine to improve readability and user experience. Good typography isn’t just choosing a font — it’s creating structure and flow for the content.

Taking time to learn these principles will definitely make future web projects more polished and professional.

Looking forward to applying these concepts in upcoming builds!
