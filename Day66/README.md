# Day 66

Today’s session focused on understanding **RESTful principles** and how they apply when building APIs with Flask. The main idea learned was that REST defines how clients communicate with a server using clear and predictable URLs together with specific HTTP methods such as **GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE**.

A key part of the lesson was how to **return JSON responses** using Flask’s `jsonify` function. Instead of sending plain text, `jsonify` allows an endpoint to return structured JSON data, which is the standard response format for APIs.

We also worked with **Postman**, learning how to send different types of requests to various API endpoints. Postman made it easy to test GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests by adding parameters, sending JSON bodies, modifying headers, and examining server responses.

Another important part of today’s lesson was using **Postman to generate documentation**. Postman can automatically create clean and shareable API documentation from saved requests in a collection, giving a clear overview of each endpoint, the request type, expected inputs, and response formats.

Overall, today strengthened the understanding of **RESTful architecture**, how to build and return JSON responses in Flask, and how to test and document an API using Postman.
