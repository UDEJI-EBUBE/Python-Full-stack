Today we created a question game called "QUIZ_BRAIN" <br>
The new thing i learnt today is that the init that is in the class is called upon when the class is called, like when you boot up your system and it shows you your screen and tells you to type your password because it is what it is told to do on boot <br>
I alos learnt a short way to bring a class from a module. When you do `import <module>` you are saying to import every module class in that module. <br>
But if you want to only inport some class in that module we do 
```
from <module> import <class>, <class>
```
