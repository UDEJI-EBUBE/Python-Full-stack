# Day 4
## Python

We started off with learning about modules today is Python which is a concept have heard but never knew knew the meaning.

It is basically like using a href in html but instead it involves import

On top of the code just refer to ur file like

`Import sample.py`

Nice right, the one I learnt about today is the random module which can be used to generate random numbers.

It generates numbers like this

1. random.randint(a, b) for generating numbers between a and b

2. random.random() for generating random floating point numbers

Note: multiply by the max you want to obtain float numbers from 0 to that number

We also Dealt with lists today. Only note to take out of that is that you can create different lists then input it in your general list to create a list of list
