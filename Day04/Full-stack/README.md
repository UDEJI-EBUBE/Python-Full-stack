Today i learnt a very useful thing in html which is the absolute and relative file paths

Absolute file paths is when you locate a file starting from the primary location like

`Cd:/local-storage/program-files`

Relative file paths as the name suggests is when you locate a file relative to the location of the file in the system.e.g

./ is used for locating files in the same folder as the file being worked on

../ is used to move one level up

Although it is something that is seen all the time that html with head and meta that is usually the first thing to appear is what is called a boilerplate. To initiate it we usually use a ! then enter.

That is all for today
